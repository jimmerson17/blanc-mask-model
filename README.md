# blanc-mask-model

repo of the 3d printable mask files provided by Blanc after their hilariously disasterous kickstarter.

their final update is as below:
We beg your pardon for the long silence. 

Our plans to attract venture funding to finalize and relaunch the project have been interrupted by the military operation in the Ukraine. Our fulfillment partner in Hong Kong, where the masks were stored, insisted that we immediately take out all the remaining inventory or they get rid of it. The contractor factory in China does not respond through any channels of communication. Part of the team who decided to stay in the Ukraine do not have stable access to the Internet because networking is not optimal in their basements. In one day we lost access to venture capital, our accounts, production, and some of the core specialists. We have neither forecasts, nor understanding of whether we can regain control of the project.

We do not make an excuse out of these for our own business failures. We made enough mistakes - both production and communication-wise - launching Blanc. We really burned and believed in our masks, and agreed to raise capital with a 100% loss of equity control over the company to be able to relaunch the project. These plans are crossed out, the current situation is not amenable to crisis management. We do not know if we will be able to continue working on the project, and if so, when.

The only thing we can do for the community right now is to move to the open source status. We are granting access to the current version of the Blanc source files: the amends made so far will allow anyone to make the mask using a 3D printer. Here is a link to the latest revision of the source files:
